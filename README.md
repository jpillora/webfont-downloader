## FAQ

#### Google already has this service available

It does, though it provides you with **only** the `.tff` files. This also service downloads
`.woff` and `.eof` files and creates a local version of the one-line include CSS file.

#### Why is `eotwoff` the default?

It is the largest download though it has the most support.
